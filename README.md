Typescript / React / Hook / SASS - basic template

### Setup
`src/sass` contains the various sass files. Not sure how they got compiled into `public/css/main.min.css`. Perhaps a manual `typescript` command. Should try and figure out how I got to this point in the template.

### Round 2
Had to first npm install node-sass, then play around with the npm command inside package.json to get it to output to the correct file and folder.
